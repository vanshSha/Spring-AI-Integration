Project Description

This Spring Boot application demonstrates various workflow patterns using Spring AI:

- Chain Workflow
- Parallel Workflow
- Routing Workflow
- Orchestrator Workflow
- Evaluator–Optimizer Pattern

 Patterns Overview

1. Chain Workflow – Sequential execution where each step depends on the previous one.
2. Parallel Workflow – Multiple tasks executed simultaneously and combined. - (MistralAI)
3. Routing Workflow – Dynamic path selection based on input conditions.
4. Orchestrator Workflow – Centralized coordination of multiple tasks and workers.
5. Evaluator – Optimizer Pattern – Iterative improvement through evaluation and refinement. - (MistralAi)
